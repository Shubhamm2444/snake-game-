# üêç Snake Game in Python using Pygame

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python with the Pygame library. The game is simple yet engaging, with dynamic speed adjustments to keep it challenging as you progress.

## üéÆ Features
- **Dynamic Speed**: The snake starts moving slowly, and its speed increases as you score more points.
- **Clean Interface**: A minimal and colorful game interface for an enjoyable experience.
- **Restart Option**: After losing, you can choose to restart or quit.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Easily tweak settings like screen size, snake speed, and block size.

## üöÄ How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right
2. Collect the white square (food) to grow your snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or yourself. If you do, the game ends.
4. After losing:
   - Press **C** to restart the game.
   - Press **Q** to quit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Explanation

### 1. **Initialization**
The game starts by initializing Pygame, setting up screen dimensions, and defining colors and fonts. The constants for block size and initial speed are also declared.

```python
pygame.init()
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
BLOCK_SIZE = 20
INITIAL_SPEED = 5
```

### 2. **Dynamic Speed**
The speed increases based on the snake's length:
```python
speed = INITIAL_SPEED + (length_of_snake - 1) // 5
```
Here, the speed increases by 1 unit for every 5 points scored.

### 3. **Main Game Loop**
The core game logic is handled in the `game_loop()` function:
- **Snake Movement**: Updates the snake's position and checks for boundary collisions.
- **Food Consumption**: Detects when the snake eats food and increases its length.
- **Self-Collision Detection**: Ends the game if the snake collides with itself.

### 4. **Restart Mechanism**
If the player loses, a message is displayed with options to restart or quit:
```python
while game_close:
    message("You lost! Press Q-Quit or C-Play Again", RED, [WIDTH / 6, HEIGHT / 3])
```
